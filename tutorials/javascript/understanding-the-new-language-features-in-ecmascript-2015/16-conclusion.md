ECMAScript 2015 (ECMAScript 6) introduces a lot of convenient syntactic sugar.
It is pretty widely supported but you should consider using a compiler like
[Babel](http://babeljs.io) if backwards compatability is a concern.

You should also take a look at Kype Simpson's book [You Don't Know JS: ES6
& Beyond](http://amzn.to/1t8FLU9). His whole series is actually rather good,
I'd recommend checking them out.
